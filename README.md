# Language-Learner

LangLearner is a text-based application that teaches and tests the user on a set of pre-made Spanish terms with their respective English translations. The user is able to choose between two levels: "Greetings and Basic Words" and "Nouns and Adjectives."

# Updates
*Version 1:* The user can select one of two levels and go through the learning sequence, and then go straight into the testing portion.

*Version 2:* The user can also select the format ("flashcards" or "test").

# Future Updates
• Making this program a GUI application (either using tkinter or Visual Basic)
• Parsing the data from SpanishDictionary or other sources
